        <summary>1. What is CSS?</summary>
        <p>CSS means Cascading Style Sheets, which is used to add style the webpages for better user interface and interactive purpose</p>
    </details>
    <details name="task">
        <summary>2. What is mean by Cascading</summary>
        <p><b>Cascading</b> in CSS refers to how styles are applied based on source order, specificity, and importance. It allows multiple style rules to affect an element, with the last defined rule taking precedence, more specific selectors overriding less specific ones, and '!important' styles overriding all. This system enables organized and flexible styling.</p>
    </details>
    <details name="task">
        <summary>3. In how many ways we can insert css into html file</summary>
        <p>There are three ways to insert CSS to HTML file.
            <ul>
                <li>Inline</li>
                <li>Internal</li>
                <li>External</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </details>
    <details name="task">
        <summary>4. which way have more specificity and why</summary>
        <p>Inline CSS has the highest specificity, overriding internal and external styles. Internal CSS comes next, while external styles have the lowest specificity. Specificity determines which styles apply when multiple rules target the same element. <br><b> Inline > Internal > External </b></p>
